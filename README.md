### Mini Projects
 
I have created several mini-projects for my GitHub repository. These projects showcase my skills in programming and machine learning. Each project demonstrates my ability to apply various techniques and concepts, allowing me to gain practical experience and deepen my understanding of these fields. I am excited to share my work and continue expanding my portfolio.
